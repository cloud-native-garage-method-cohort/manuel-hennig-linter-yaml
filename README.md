# manuel-hennig-linter-yaml
public repository with a mixture of valid and invalid YAML files
#### Problem 2
[YAML](https://yaml.org/) is the format used by Kubernetes and Tekton. Find an open source Tekton Task for Linting YAML files. Next, create a _public repository_ in the cohort's GitHub organization. In that repository put a mixture of valid and invalid YAML files. Create a Pipeline that uses `git-clone` and the `Task` you found to lint the YAML files in your repository. Correct your invalid YAML and commit that to the repository you made. Re-run your pipeline. Make a commit to the `assignments` repository with two files: (1) your Pipeline YAML and (2) a text file, named `yaml-linting-pipeline.log`, that contains the Logs of your pipeline run.
